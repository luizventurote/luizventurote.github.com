	<p class="intro">Hi my name is Luiz Venturote. I'm a Magento front-end developer at <a href="https://www.randwmedia.com/" target="_blank">R&W Media</a>. Currently I'm also studying information system at <a href="http://www.ifes.edu.br/" target="_blank">Ifes</a> in Brazil.</p>

	<p>I love internet and web development. I have worked with Wordpress and design for several years, creating layouts and applications. But now I am keeping the focus of my work in e-commerce development with Magento, creating themes and extensions and I got my first <a href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/certification/directory/dev/2261168/" target="_blank">front-end certification</a> in early 2016.</p>

	<p>I enjoy music, learning foreign languages and Bible. If you want to know more about me or on those issues, please <a href="mailto:{{ site.social.email }}">contact me!</a></p>
